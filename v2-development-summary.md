# Festival Ready v2.0 Development Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ **Project Goal**
Expand Festival Ready from supporting only screenwriters (30% of users) to supporting both filmmakers AND screenwriters (100% of users).

## âœ… **Completed in This Session**

### **1. Landing Page Updates**
- Updated title: "Optimize Your Film and Screenplay Submissions"
- Updated hero section to include both films and screenplays
- Updated tagline: "Professional Submission Materials for Filmmakers & Screenwriters"
- Updated version badge to v002
- Updated "How It Works" section to be inclusive of both creative types

### **2. Database Schema Design**
- Created comprehensive database update script (`manual-database-update.sql`)
- Added new columns to `submissions` table:
  - `submission_type` (screenplay/film)
  - `film_category` (Action Feature Film, Comedy Film, etc.)
  - `runtime_minutes` (instead of page_count for films)
  - `creator_roles` (array: director, writer, producer, actor)
  - `statement_type` (which type of statement to generate)
  - `audience_type` (general/mature)
- Created `film_categories` reference table with 80+ categories
- Created `creator_roles` reference table with role-specific statement prefixes

### **3. Film Categories Data**
- Complete list of 80+ film festival categories parsed and structured
- Includes runtime requirements, audience types, descriptions, and award names
- Categories cover: Action, Animation, Comedy, Dark Comedy, Drama, Documentary, Experimental, Fantasy, Horror, Science Fiction, etc.
- Formats: Feature Film (31-120 min), Film (7-30 min), Micro Film (â‰¤6 min), Series Episode (â‰¤30 min), Music Video (â‰¤6-10 min)

### **4. Questionnaire Structure Planning**
- Added new Step 1: Submission Type Selection (Film vs Screenplay)
- Updated questionnaire header to be generic
- Planned branching logic for film-specific vs screenplay-specific questions

## ðŸ”§ **Next Steps Required**

### **Phase 1: Database Implementation**
1. **Apply database schema changes**:
   - Run `manual-database-update.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
   - Test that new columns and tables are created properly
   - Verify existing data is preserved

### **Phase 2: Questionnaire Logic Updates**
1. **Complete questionnaire restructuring**:
   - Fix duplicate step IDs in questionnaire.html
   - Implement branching logic based on submission type
   - Add film-specific questions:
     - Runtime instead of page count
     - Film category selection (from our 80+ categories)
     - Creator role selection (Director/Writer/Producer/Actor)
     - Statement type selection

2. **Add conditional question display**:
   - Show runtime question for films, page count for screenplays
   - Show film categories for films, keep existing genre system for screenplays
   - Show role selection for films, skip for screenplays

### **Phase 3: Backend Integration**
1. **Update form submission logic**:
   - Modify JavaScript to handle new fields
   - Update validation to check appropriate fields based on submission type
   - Ensure proper data mapping to new database columns

2. **Update AI processing webhook**:
   - Modify to handle film submissions differently than screenplay submissions
   - Use role-specific statement prefixes from creator_roles table
   - Generate appropriate content based on film category vs screenplay genre

### **Phase 4: Testing & Validation**
1. **Test both submission paths**:
   - Complete screenplay submission (existing functionality)
   - Complete film submission (new functionality)
   - Verify correct data storage and AI processing

2. **User experience testing**:
   - Ensure smooth flow between submission types
   - Validate that appropriate questions are shown/hidden
   - Test role-based statement generation

## ðŸ“Š **Technical Architecture**

### **Database Schema**
```sql
submissions table:
- submission_type: 'screenplay' | 'film'
- film_category: varchar(100) -- for films only
- runtime_minutes: integer -- for films only  
- creator_roles: text[] -- ['director', 'writer'] for films
- statement_type: varchar(50) -- 'director_statement', etc.
- audience_type: 'general' | 'mature'
- page_count: integer -- for screenplays only (existing)
```

### **Questionnaire Flow**
```
Step 1: Submission Type Selection
â”œâ”€â”€ Film Path:
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Runtime (minutes)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Film Category Selection
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Creator Role Selection  
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Statement Type Selection
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Film-specific questions
â””â”€â”€ Screenplay Path:
    â”œâ”€â”€ Page Count
    â”œâ”€â”€ Genre Selection (existing)
    â””â”€â”€ Screenplay-specific questions (existing)
```

### **AI Processing Logic**
```javascript
if (submission_type === 'film') {
  // Use film category for processing
  // Use creator role prefix for statement
  // Generate role-specific content
} else {
  // Existing screenplay processing
}
```

## ðŸŽ¬ **Impact Metrics**
- **Current Users**: ~30% screenwriters
- **Target Users**: 100% (screenwriters + filmmakers)
- **New Categories**: 80+ film festival categories vs existing screenplay genres
- **New Statement Types**: 4 role-based statements vs 1 writer's statement

## ðŸš€ **Ready for Implementation**
All planning, data modeling, and initial code changes are complete. The next session should focus on:
1. Applying database changes
2. Completing questionnaire implementation
3. Testing the full workflow

The foundation is solid and the expansion plan is comprehensive!
