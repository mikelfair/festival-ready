Standard AI Prompt Tagline	Do not share this field publicly. Do not process fields marked "Not Used" Use the user inputs to create a sentence at the 9th grade US High School Reading level that is optimally 10 words but should be no longer than 15 words or less. Use the information provided by the user to craft a compelling tagline that is meant to generate interest in the film, but does not reveal the ending. As an example, the tagline for the feature length comedy film "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" is "One man's mission to take it easy." The tagline for the science fiction feature film "Alien" was "In space, noone can hear you scream." The tagline does not specifically state the character's name, or the genre."
