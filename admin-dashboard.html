Plan for Festival Ready App Updates
1. Questionnaire Step Reordering & Updates
Current Structure → New Structure:

Step 1: Title → Step 1: Country (moved from Step 15)
Step 2: Writers → Step 2: Title (was Step 1)
Step 3: Genre → Step 3: Writers (was Step 2)
... (all other steps shift by 1)
Step 14: Email → Step 14: Email (same position)
Step 15: Country → Step 15: Combined Marketing Opt-in (simplified)

Step 15 Changes (Email Preferences):

Remove checkbox #1 (app updates)
Update checkbox #2 to combine both purposes
New single checkbox text: "I'd like to receive monthly emails about Festival Ready app updates and film festival submission discounts for our twelve festivals in Portland, Austin, and Georgia."

2. Admin Dashboard Updates
New Stats Box:

Add 7th box: "Total Email Opt-ins"
Count unique email addresses that have ever opted in
Must check both old checkboxes (update_emails OR festival_discounts = true)

Remove App Usage Section:

Delete entire "App Usage" table and section

Update Submissions Management Columns:

Current columns: ID | Email | Title | Status | Date | Actions
New columns: ID | Email | Title | AI Cost | Country | Actions
Pull AI cost from processing_analytics table
Display country from submissions table

Test Data Filtering:

Hide these emails from ALL displays and calculations:

mikel.fair@filmfestivalcircuit.com
chambersdavid@live.co.uk
mikelfair@gmail.com


Only hide EXISTING submissions (not future ones)
Affects: stats boxes, purchase history, submissions list, category breakdown

3. Backend Updates Required
admin-dashboard-api:

Add logic to filter out test emails
Calculate unique email opt-ins
Remove app usage query
Join processing_analytics for AI cost in submissions

process-screenplay.txt:

Update to handle single marketing checkbox
Map single checkbox to both update_emails and festival_discounts fields

4. Database Considerations
Existing Data:

Need to mark existing test submissions
Could add a test_data boolean field to submissions table
Or filter by email + created_at date

Migration Strategy:

Users who checked either checkbox previously should still be counted as opted-in
New submissions will only have one checkbox but should update both fields

Implementation Order:

Update Questionnaire HTML (move country to step 1, update email preferences)
Update Backend API (add test data filtering, email opt-in counting)
Update Admin Dashboard HTML (new stats box, remove app usage, update columns)
Update process-screenplay (handle single checkbox)
Test everything with non-test email

Questions Before Implementation:

Test Data Cutoff Date: Should we hide ALL historical submissions from these test emails, or only those before a certain date?
Email Opt-in Display: For the new "Total Email Opt-ins" box, should it show:

Just the number (e.g., "245")
Number with percentage (e.g., "245 (18.5%)")


AI Cost Display: How should we format the AI cost in the table?

Show full precision (e.g., "$0.0234")
Round to cents (e.g., "$0.02")
Show in a different format?



Would you like me to proceed with this plan? Any adjustments needed?RetryMFLets make this sentence event shorter "New single checkbox text: "I'd like to receive monthly emails about Festival Ready app updates and film festival submission discounts for our twelve festivals in Portland, Austin, and Georgia."

Ready to proceed with implementation? We'll start with the questionnaire updates first.RetryMFyes. I'm ready to implement. Let's do them 1 at a time. rewrite the entire code for each section that we are working on .EditStrategized questionnaire restructuring with systematic step modifications.2sThe user wants to implement the changes one at a time, starting with the questionnaire updates. I need to:

Move Country from Step 15 to Step 1
Shift all other steps by 1
Update Step 15 to have only one checkbox for marketing emails with the new shorter text
Remove the first checkbox about app updates

I'll need to rewrite the entire questionnaire.html file with these changes.Perfect! Let's start with the questionnaire updates. I'll provide the complete updated questionnaire.html file.
Step 1: Update questionnaire.html
Here's the complete updated file with:

Country moved to Step 1
All other steps shifted by 1
Single marketing checkbox in Step 15 with shorter text
Updated questionnaire.htmlInteractive artifact ∙ Version 3 Strategized questionnaire updates and backend modifications for app.7sThe user has received the updated questionnaire.html file with:

Country moved to Step 1
All other steps shifted by 1
Single marketing checkbox with shorter text
Removed the app updates checkbox

The main changes include:

Step 1 is now Country (was Step 15)
All other steps are shifted by 1
Step 15 now has only one checkbox for marketing emails with the text "I'd like to receive monthly emails about Festival Ready app updates and film festival submission discounts."
The single checkbox maps to both update_emails and festival_discounts fields in the database

Next, they'll need to update the backend API to handle the test data filtering and add the email opt-in counting.Implementation Instructions for questionnaire.html
Perfect! Here's what was changed in the questionnaire:
Changes Made:

Country moved to Step 1 - Now the first question users see
All other steps shifted by 1 - Title is now Step 2, Writers is Step 3, etc.
Email preferences simplified - Single checkbox with text: "I'd like to receive monthly emails about Festival Ready app updates and film festival submission discounts."
Backend compatibility - The single checkbox will set BOTH update_emails and festival_discounts to true/false

How to Deploy:

Copy the entire updated questionnaire.html from above
Replace your current questionnaire.html file
Test the form to ensure:

Country appears as Step 1
All steps flow correctly
The single marketing checkbox appears in Step 15



Important Notes:

The single checkbox (marketingEmails) will automatically map to both database fields
This maintains backward compatibility with existing users who checked either box
The form validation has been updated for the new step numbers

Once you've deployed and tested the questionnaire, let me know and we'll move on to updating the backend API to handle test data filtering and email opt-in counting!RetryMFquestionnaire.html has been updated and it looks like its working.EditStrategized backend API updates for questionnaire processing.4sGreat! The questionnaire is updated and working. Now I need to move to the backend API updates. According to the plan, I need to:

Add logic to filter out test emails (only for submissions before June 25, 2025)
Calculate unique email opt-ins with percentage
Remove app usage query entirely
Join processing_analytics for AI cost (rounded to 2 decimals)

Let me prepare the updated admin-dashboard-api.txt file.Excellent! Now let's update the backend API to handle the test data filtering and add the email opt-in counting.
Step 2: Update admin-dashboard-api.txt
Here's the complete updated backend API with:

Test data filtering (submissions before June 25, 2025)
New email opt-in calculation with percentage
App usage section removed
AI cost data joined and rounded to 2 decimals
Updated admin-dashboard-api.txtText import { createClient } from 'https://esm.sh/@supabase/supabase-js@2.45.4';

  headers.set('content-type', 'application/json');
  headers.set('access-control-allow-origin', '*');
  headers.setRefined API dashboard with updated filtering and opt-in stats.4sThe admin-dashboard-api has been updated with:

Test data filtering logic that excludes the three email addresses for submissions before June 25, 2025
Email opt-in calculation that counts unique emails who have opted in to either update_emails OR festival_discounts
Removed app usage query entirely
Added totalOptIns to the stats with percentage format

Now I need to provide deployment instructions.Implementation Instructions for admin-dashboard-api
Here's what was changed in the backend API:
Changes Made:

Test Data Filtering - Excludes these emails for submissions before June 25, 2025:

mikel.fair@filmfestivalcircuit.com
chambersdavid@live.co.uk
mikelfair@gmail.com


Email Opt-ins Calculation:

Counts unique email addresses that opted in (either checkbox)
Returns format: "245 (18.5%)"
Stored in stats.totalOptIns


Removed App Usage:

Completely removed the app usage query and data


All calculations exclude test data:

Total submissions
Recent submissions
Email sent count
Total AI cost
Category breakdown
Revenue calculations



How to Deploy:

Copy the entire updated admin-dashboard-api.txt from above
Replace your current admin-dashboard-api edge function
Deploy to Supabase:
bashsupabase functions deploy admin-dashboard-api


Testing:
After deployment, check that:

Test emails no longer appear in any stats
The API returns totalOptIns with percentage
No app usage data is returned

Let me know once this is deployed and working, then we'll move on to updating the admin dashboard HTML to display the new stats and remove the app usage section!RetryMFI got an error when updated admin-dashboard-apiEditDiagnosed API deployment error and refined filtering logic.5sThe user is getting an error when deploying the admin-dashboard-api. The error message shown in the screenshot indicates that the edge function failed to create the graph. The specific error appears to be related to parsing or syntax issues in the code.
Looking at the error, it seems to be a syntax error in the code. Let me review the admin-dashboard-api code I provided to find any issues.
Looking at the code, I see a potential issue in the filter logic. The way I'm constructing the SQL queries for filtering test data might be causing issues. Specifically, the .or() method usage might be incorrect.
Let me fix the code with a simpler approach to filtering test data.I see the error. There's a syntax issue with how I'm filtering the test data. Let me fix the admin-dashboard-api with a cleaner approach:Updated admin-dashboard-api.txtText ∙ Version 2 import { createClient } from 'https://esm.sh/@supabase/supabase-js@2.45.4';
Deno.serve(async (req)=>{
  const headers = new Headers();
  headers.set('content-type', 'application/json');
  headers.set('access-control-allow-origin', '*');
  headers.setRefactored API to resolve syntax errors by manual filtering4sI've rewritten the admin-dashboard-api to fix the syntax errors. The main changes:

Removed the complex .or() queries that were causing syntax errors
Instead, I'm fetching all data and filtering it manually in JavaScript
This is cleaner and avoids the SQL syntax issues
The filtering logic remains the same - exclude test emails before June 25, 2025

This approach is slightly less efficient (fetching all data then filtering) but for an admin dashboard with reasonable data volumes, it should work fine.Fixed admin-dashboard-api
I've fixed the syntax errors. The main issue was with the complex SQL filtering. I've simplified it by:

Fetching all data first, then filtering in JavaScript
Cleaner code that's easier to maintain
Same filtering logic: excludes test emails before June 25, 2025

Key Changes:

Removed complex .or() queries that were causing syntax errors
Manual filtering of test data after fetching
All test email filtering is consistent throughout

Deploy Instructions:

Copy the entire fixed code above
Replace your admin-dashboard-api.txt
Deploy again:
bashsupabase functions deploy admin-dashboard-api


This approach is simpler and should deploy without errors. The performance impact of filtering in JavaScript rather than SQL should be minimal for an admin dashboard.
Let me know once this deploys successfully!RetryMFstill getting an errorEditDiagnosed deployment error and strategized code refinement.3sThe user is still getting an error with the deployment. Looking at the error message in the image, it seems to be related to the edge function deployment. The error message shows it's having trouble with the module parsing or syntax.
Let me look at the code more carefully. The issue might be with how I'm handling the Supabase client or some other syntax issue. Let me provide a more basic, cleaner version that should definitely work.I see the issue. Let me provide a cleaner, more straightforward version of the admin-dashboard-api that should deploy without errors:Updated admin-dashboard-api.txtText ∙ Version 3 import { createClient } from 'https://esm.sh/@supabase/supabase-js@2.45.4';

    'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'authorization, x-client-info, apikey, contenRevamped API structure to resolve deployment complications.3sI've rewritten the admin-dashboard-api with a cleaner structure that should avoid the deployment error. The main changes:

Simplified the CORS headers handling
Used more straightforward async/await patterns
Removed complex query builders in favor of simpler queries + JavaScript filtering
Made the code more linear and easier to follow
Fixed potential issues with header handling

This should deploy successfully.Simplified admin-dashboard-api
I've completely rewritten the API to be cleaner and simpler. Key improvements:

Cleaner structure - More straightforward code flow
Simpler CORS handling - Fixed potential header issues
Better error handling - Wrapped everything in try/catch
No complex SQL queries - Simple queries + JavaScript filtering

Deploy Instructions:

Remove the entire App Usage section
Update the Submissions Management table columns (remove Status and Date, add AI Cost and Country)
Make sure the JavaScript code handles the new data structure from the API

I'll need to rewrite the entire admin-dashboard.html file to make these changes.Excellent! Now let's update the admin dashboard HTML to display the new email opt-ins stat and remove the app usage section.
